# WarriorBlockEngineC

A game engine made in C with SDL3. This engine plans to support the creation of a variety of games and genres, with
many convenient features to implement changes to games quickly and easily. This is a massive project that will likely take years to complete.

# Implemented Features
-A Clock API that is used to keep track of CPU Cycles, Frames, and Ticks, and the ability to assign functions to any of those clocks so that they can be called at appropriate times.

# Immediate Plans:
-Add the ability to create timers in the Clock API.
-Create a Window API for easy management of windows.
-Add complete error detection for functions that take in arguments.
-Add error correction for bad arguments.

# Long-Term Plans:
-A full, easy to use API to handle many aspects of game creation, while handling the technicalities in the background.
-Automatic handling of memory, as much as possible, so the user has a smoother API experience.
-A 2D editor that'll allow for the creation of various games.
